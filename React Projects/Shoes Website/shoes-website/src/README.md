# 👟 Shoe Brand Landing Page — React Project #1

This is the **first project** in my React learning series — a **modern, responsive landing page** for a fictional shoe brand. The project is beginner-friendly and built with a component-based architecture using **React.js**.

It features a clean UI, mobile responsiveness, a dark mode toggle, and various reusable components to help you understand React fundamentals in action.

## 🛠️ How To Make This Project (Step-by-Step)

> You can build this project from scratch using these steps:

### 1. **Setup React App**

```bash
npx create-react-app shoes-website
cd shoes-website
npm start
```

---

### 2. **Clean Boilerplate**

* Remove boilerplate code from `App.js`, `App.css`, and `index.css`
* Clean up `public/index.html` if needed

---

### 3. **Create Folder Structure**

Inside `src/`, create a `components/` folder and add:

* `Navbar.js`
* `HeroSection.js`
* `Features.js`
* `BrandIcons.js`
* `DarkModeToggle.js`

Each component should return JSX and have its own scoped CSS (can use modules or plain CSS)

---

### 4. **Dark Mode Toggle Logic**

* Use `useState` to toggle dark mode
* Use `useEffect` to persist state in `localStorage`

```js
const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(
  localStorage.getItem("darkMode") === "true"
);

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem("darkMode", darkMode);
}, [darkMode]);
```

---

### 5. **Add Responsive Styling**

* Use media queries in `App.css` or Tailwind/CSS-in-JS
* Make sure the layout adjusts for both desktop and mobile

---

### 6. **Add Brand Icons**

* Add logos (Amazon, Flipkart) as images or use FontAwesome icons

---

### 7. **Accessibility**

* Use `role="menubar"`, `role="menuitem"` on navigation for accessibility
* Use `aria-label` where needed

---
